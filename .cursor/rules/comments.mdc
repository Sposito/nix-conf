# Cooments
- Good documented code is code that is self explanatory.
- It is ok to write comments to guide your flow, but it is important to remove the unuseful one at the end.
    - when commenting add a small signature in the start of the line
    - like a ðŸš§ emoji so you remember removing it later
    - this is also valid for placeholder comments for future code iterations
- Only use comments for pitfals or hard to grap but unavoidable hacks
